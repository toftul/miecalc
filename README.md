# Mie Calculator

### What is it?

There two MATLAB toolboxes:

1. `MieCalc.mlapp` — calculation of the cross sections (scattering and extinction) of nanoparticles of different materials (Au, Ag, Cu, Si). Calculations are based on the Mie scattering theory (e.g. *Absorption and scattering of light by small particles* by Bohren & Huffman).
2. `SkinDepth.mlapp`— Skin depth calculator based on data from [refractiveindex.info](https://refractiveindex.info). 

This is a part of the support software for the course [Plasmonics: From Fundamentals to Modern Applications](https://www.edx.org/course/plasmonics-from-fundamentals-to-modern-applications) on the [edx.org](https://www.edx.org) platform. 

### How to open it

To launch the app just open the 'MieCalc.mlapp' file in MATLAB. This is a MATLAB GUI app created by the App Designer. Should work with MATLAB 2016b or higher.

If you have any comment or suggestions please feel free to contact me.
